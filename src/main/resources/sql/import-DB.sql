Honor their time - Tardiness to a job interview gives the prospective employer the impression of laziness and lack of consideration for their time. Make an entrance no more than 10 minutes prior to the interview start time to prevent rushing the interviewer. If the meeting takes place via Skype or phone, call or go online just a minute or two before the scheduled interview — but test all equipment well beforehand. 2.- Remember that courtesy starts at the reception desk. Treat everyone you encounter at a prospective workplace with the same courtesy expected by the CEO. This behavior shows good manners. 3. Do your homework - Prepare answers to common interview questions before the interview, and practice responses with a trusted individual. Preparing answers in advance eliminates the dreaded, “Uh…” 4. Smile and shake hands - Confidence radiates from a smile, so wear one when you’re meeting an interviewer. When you’re interviewing on the phone, wear a genuine smile while greeting the prospective employer. Without visuals, a smile still gives a friendly but professional impression, even influencing your voice. 5. Have an elevator pitch - The toughest question in many job interviews is well-known: “Tell us why you’re right for this position.” Have an instant comeback by perfecting an elevator pitch that highlights your unique talents. The response will come naturally if it’s practiced in advance — just avoid sounding like a robot or someone reading a script.', current_timestamp,1);

Your brain gets fatigued after a while, and maybe that’s the reason why you can’t get anything done right. 6. Don’t let stress bottle up; be honest about anxiety - If you let pressure build up inside, you will become more and more anxious and miss out on finding the fun and interest in actually learning. 7.
